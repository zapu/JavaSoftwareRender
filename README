Software 3d renderer, for learning purposes

Painfully slow and bug-ridden but draws perspective-correct textured triangles with some not-so-correct lighting.

Expect non commented messy code. But it should be clean enough to follow and write your own renderer.

Vertex projecting should resemble OpenGL pipeline.

Texture filling - not quite. Uses Bresenham's line algorythm and barycentric coordinates to interpolate texture UV/colors/etc.

Dynamic lighting with bump mapping is there, but is not correct for some reason.
